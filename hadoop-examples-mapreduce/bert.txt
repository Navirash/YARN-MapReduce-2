This thesis explores the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the quality of conversations in the banking sector. The study begins with an overview of AI, focusing on its potential in generating coherent and relevant interactions. The theoretical foundations of generative AI are examined, along with its practical applications and ethical considerations. Additionally, the environmental impact associated with its implementation is discussed.

In the context of the banking industry, effective communication with customers is of paramount importance. This research highlights the significance of communication within the sector and provides an understanding of the various channels used to engage with customers.

The study investigates different techniques and models for natural language generation. It explores supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning methods, as well as various neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), and generative adversarial networks (GAN). Furthermore, the research examines the use of pre-trained language models like BERT, LLAMA, GPT3, and GPT4.

A comprehensive research methodology is presented, including data collection and preprocessing techniques. The thesis emphasizes the importance of data vectorization using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach.

The analysis and evaluation section of this study encompasses two main approaches. The first approach involves utilizing language chains and leveraging pre-trained language models, while the second approach focuses on conversation analysis through clustering techniques such as K-means and Bertopic. Evaluation criteria for assessing the quality of the generated text are explored, taking into consideration the environmental implications of the results.

The findings of this research shed light on how generative AI can be effectively employed to generate coherent and relevant conversations in the banking sector. The study contributes valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of different approaches, emphasizing the need to evaluate the quality of generated text. Moreover, it highlights the environmental impact associated with the implementation of generative AI in this domain.
